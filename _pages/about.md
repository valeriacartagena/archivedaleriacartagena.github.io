    Hello! I'm Valeria Cartagena, a rising sophomore at Stanford University, pursuing my passion for chemical engineering and deeply committed to advancing the global energy transition. Originally from Bolivia, a country close to my heart, I've witnessed firsthand how energy dynamics shape economies, particularly in developing nations still reliant on traditional fossil fuels.

    My journey into STEM began with a profound love for mathematics and cs, culminating in representing my country on international competitions, such as the IMO, EGMO, EGOI, and the Iberoamerical Olympiads of Mathematics and Informatics. This experiences not only challenged me but also ignited a determination for advocating access to quality education and narrowing the gender gap in STEM fields, where I often found myself as a minority.

    Beyond academics, I find joy in exploring diverse interests. Whether I'm immersed in books, indulging in classic movies and music, mastering the art of cooking Bolivian dishes, or capturing nature's beauty through painting and photography, each experience enriches my perspective and fuels my creativity.

    Join me as I navigate the intersections of science, engineering, sustainability, and personal growth. Together, let's explore pathways towards a more equitable and sustainable future!
